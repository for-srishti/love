                <h2>Take a chance on me.</h2>
                <div class="letter-content">
                    <p>I know those words are wrought with uncertainty. I know you've taken chances before and they have flopped and floundered and left you high and dry. I know that you are scared to start again after everything before this has failed you – I am too. But baby if I have to fail again, it is you I want to go down in flames with. I know that nothing ever works out but if it does, it would be this. It would be here. It would be you and me and whatever this fire is between us.</p>

                    <p>Take a chance on me. Because the timing's always going to be wrong and the stars are never going to align but I would break every clock in this city and I'd shut every star down from shining if it meant that for one afternoon we could cast all that aside and give in. Give in to the complete impossibility that something could work here, despite everything that stands in the way. Give in to the way that your touch makes me shiver and your words make my mind race and reel. Give in to the improbability that this is going to work out or end well or fall into place exactly as we'd hoped or that any of it will be even half worth it in the end. Give in to senselessness. Give in to you, finally giving in to me.</p>

                    <p>Take a chance on me – because tomorrow the Universe could collapse in on itself and this city could disintegrate to ashes and the sun could burst into a thousand disjointed rays and goddammit if I am going to die never knowing what it feels like to have your lips on mine. Because when the end comes, you could be at work filing papers and I could be sipping a latte at the coffee shop and your last thought could be "This paper won't– " and mine could be "What a delicious dr– " but when that blinding flash of light emerges and our last moments on earth splinter senselessly, I want to remember the way you laughed right into my mouth while you kissed me and the feeling of your skin against mine.</p>

                    <p>Take a chance on me because no chance ever works out. Because every relationship seems to end in heartbreak and every new beginning eventually reaches a conclusion but we have all of the time in the world between those two points and I intend to enjoy every second. Because someday I might hate the way you squint when you're concentrating and you might despise the way I pace when I'm nervous but right now you are perfect and endearing and pure and why shouldn't we get to enjoy that? Because everything ends eventually and the whole point is to love what's in between and if for me that gets to be you, then I am happy.</p>
