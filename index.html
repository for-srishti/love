                <div class="letter-content">
                    <p>I know those words are wrought with uncertainty. I know you've taken chances before and they have flopped and floundered and left you high and dry. I know that you are scared to start again after everything before this has failed you ‚Äì I am too. But baby if I have to fail again, it is you I want to go down in flames with. I know that nothing ever works out but if it does, it would be this. It would be here. It would be you and me and whatever this fire is between us.</p>

                    <p><strong>Take a chance on me</strong> ‚Äì because tomorrow the Universe could collapse in on itself and this city could disintegrate to ashes and the sun could burst into a thousand disjointed rays and goddammit if I am going to die never knowing what it feels like to have your lips on mine. Because when the end comes, you could be at work filing papers and I could be sipping a latte at the coffee shop and your last thought could be "This paper won't‚Äì " and mine could be "What a delicious dr‚Äì " but when that blinding flash of light emerges and our last moments on earth splinter senselessly, I want to remember the way you laughed right into my mouth while you kissed me and the feeling of your skin against mine.</p>

                    These were words from a book i like, which i felt described you accurately. My thoughts are a bit more simplistic and primal. I want you Srishti, all of you. It doesn't matter to me if I must wait a year in LDR. I want you. Always.</p>
